# Gimbal

Gimbal is an overarching set of projects that includes Contour.  Gimbal builds on and expands to look at Load Balancing through more complicated environments.

Contour is concentrating on providing a solution for a single cluster.  Gimbal expands on this goal to solve scenarios that involve multiple clusters, and load balancing to non-Kubernetes resources.
